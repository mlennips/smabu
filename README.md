# Overview
This project serves as a practical exercise to explore Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles while implementing a Clean Architecture approach. I utilize ASP.NET Core with a Minimal API setup used by a Single Page Application (SPA).

## Features
- Implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- Clean architecture promoting separation of concerns
- Minimal API structure for streamlined development
- React Single Page Application (SPA) 
- RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform framework for building modern web applications.
- Minimal API: A simplified way to build APIs with ASP.NET Core.
- React/TypeScript: For the front-end SPA.
- Azure CosmosDB: Database for persistence.

## Architecture
The project follows a Clean Architecture pattern, which includes:
- Domain Layer: Contains business logic and domain entities.
- Application Layer: Responsible for application-specific logic and use cases.
- Infrastructure Layer: Contains data access and external services.
- Presentation Layer: Handles API endpoints and client-side interactions.

### Further patterns:
- Result
- Mediator
- Command
- CQRS (Approach)
